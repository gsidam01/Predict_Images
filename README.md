Predict presence/absence of features in images


I wrote a similar project for a class in college, but our data was a set of hand-drawn 8s and 9s.
In college, my team would frequently sail at MIT, so we would use their boathouse cameras to determine the day's conditions.
I have combined the underlying principles of my project with the data from the MIT cameras to predict whether there is a person on the dock or a sailboat in the water in any given still image.
